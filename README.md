## PID Controller

The goal of this project is to develop a PID controller which successfully drives the vehicle around the track in the provided simulator.

Conrtoller is implemented in PID.cpp
At each step PID is updated from main.cpp:67-68
After steering value is calculated in PID, it is limited around -1, +1 at main.cpp:69-70

## Tuning parameters of PID

I have tuned the parameters manually. The effects of parameters can be summarized as follows:

Kp:  Decreases rise time but increases overshoot. Also steady state error is decreased.

Ki:  Decreases steady state error but increases both overshoot and settling time.

Kd:  Decreases overshoot and settling time.

I have start tuning with Kp than Ki and Kd. After first iteration i have updated all 3 parameters for a few more iteration and ended up with final parameter set:

Kp: 0.15
Ki: 0.001
Kd: 2.5

Actually Ki has a very small effect because the road is not straight, error is always changing and steady state error does not effects so much.

  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`.
